00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.100
Think of something awesome

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.400
Now, make it even better!

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.000
That's exactly what addons do for Firefox

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.700
You can use them to customize,

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.700
personalize and enhance your browsing experience

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.800
on both your desktop and mobile.

7
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.800
For example -

8
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.300
you can change the look of your browser

9
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.800
based on your mood and style.

1
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.800
To this,

1
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.200
or this,

1
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.500
or even this!

1
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.600
Or say you're shopping for a new gizmo.

1
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.700
An addon can help you to find the best price.

1
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.700
Just like that!

1
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.600
Addons can also make searching

1
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.200
a thing of beauty.

1
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.900
And let you share stuff with your friends

1
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.900
right from the page you're on.

2
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.000
I'm glad you like it 👍

2
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.700
Next time you're heading off on holiday,

2
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.300
addons can help there too, with everything

2
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.000
from getting there, to the weather,

2
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.300
to places to stay!

2
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.900
And if you come across a site in another language,

2
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.900
there are addons that can translate it for you.

2
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.200
Best of all -

2
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.300
they are supereasy to install.

2
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.700
Just a couple of clicks

3
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.000
and you're done.

3
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.000
With thousands to choose from

3
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.500
there's an addon for just about anything

3
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.000
to help put you in control of your Web.

3
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.600
Give addons a try.

3
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.800
And make your Firefox more awesome than ever.
